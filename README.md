# What is DigitalFate?

DigitalFate provides an advanced, enterprise-ready framework for orchestrating LLM calls, agents, and computer-based tasks in a cost-efficient manner. It delivers reliable systems, scalability, and a task-oriented architecture to handle real-world applications effectively.

**Key Features:**

- **Scalable for Production**: Effortlessly deploy on AWS, GCP, or locally via Docker.
- **Task-Focused Architecture**: Execute tasks at varying levels of complexity:
  - Simple tasks through LLM calls.
  - Intermediate tasks using V1 agents.
  - Advanced automation with V2 agents and MCP integration.
- **MCP Server Compatibility**: Leverage multi-client processing for high-performance operations.
- **Secure Tool-Calling Server**: Manage tools with robust API interactions.
- **Computer Use Integration**: Perform human-like tasks with Anthropic's ‚ÄòComputer Use‚Äô capabilities.
- **Easy Tool Integration**: Add custom or MCP tools with a single line of code.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: A stateless, enterprise-ready system designed for production.

# üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- OpenAI or Anthropic API keys (supports Azure and Bedrock)

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install DigitalFate for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@koducoder/DigitalFate):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @koducoder/DigitalFate --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
pip install digitalfate
```

## Basic Example

```python
from digitalfate import digitalfateClient, ObjectResponse, Task, AgentConfiguration
from digitalfate.client.tools import Search

# Initialize Client and Configure
client = digitalfateClient("localserver")
client.set_config("OPENAI_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")

# Define Task and Agent
task1 = Task(description="Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI", tools=[Search])

product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    job_title="Product Manager",
    company_url="https://digitalfate.ai",
    company_objective="To build an AI agent framework that helps people accomplish tasks",
)

# Execute Task with Agent
client.agent(product_manager_agent, task1)

result = task1.response

print(result)
```

# Advanced Example

```python
from digitalfate import digitalfateClient, ObjectResponse, Task, AgentConfiguration
from digitalfate.client.tools import Search

# Create a DigitalFate client instance
client = digitalfateClient("localserver")
client.set_config("OPENAI_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY")
client.default_llm_model = "openai/gpt-4o"

# DeepSeek Chat

client.set_config("DEEPSEEK_API_KEY", "YOUR_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY")
client.default_llm_model = "deepseek/deepseek-chat"

# Claude-3.5-Sonnet

client.set_config("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
client.default_llm_model = "claude/claude-3-5-sonnet"

# GPT 4o on Azure
client.set_config("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
client.default_llm_model = "claude/claude-3-5-sonnet"

# Claude 3.5 Sonnet on AWS
client.set_config("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
client.set_config("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
client.set_config("AWS_REGION", "YOUR_AWS_REGION")
client.default_llm_model = "bedrock/claude-3-5-sonnet"
```

# Task Definition

Tasks are defined by their descriptions. High-level tasks are broken into manageable sub-tasks automatically. For example, the task "Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI" may result in subtasks like:

"Search for Anthropic and OpenAI news on Google."
"Read relevant blogs."
"Review official announcements."

# Define Task Description

```python
description = "Research latest news in Anthropic and OpenAI"
```

# Task Execution

Combine agents and tasks, then run them using the DigitalFate server. This approach simplifies task execution in SaaS applications or vertical AI systems.

```python
client.agent(product_manager_agent, task1)

result = task1.response

for item in result.news_list:
    print("\nNews")
    print("Title: ", item.title)
    print("Body: ", item.body)
    print("URL: ", item.url)
    print("Tags: ", item.tags)
```

# Additional Features (Beta)

## Single LLM Call

Optimize cost and latency by deciding when to directly call an LLM instead of deploying agents.

```python
client.call(task1)
```

## Memory System

Enable personalized, context-aware interactions by leveraging memory settings in AgentConfiguration.

```python
product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    agent_id="product_manager_agent",
    memory=True,
)
```

## Knowledge Base

Provide agents with context through private or public content, such as PDFs or URLs.

```python
from digitalfate import KnowledgeBase

kb = KnowledgeBase(files=["sample.pdf", "https://digitalfate.ai"])

task1 = Task(context=[kb])
```

## Task Chaining

Link tasks together by using the output of one as the input for another.

```python
task2 = Task(context=[task1])
```

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

Distribute tasks across multiple agents for collaborative problem-solving.

```python
client.multi_agent([agent1, agent2], [task1, task2])
```

## Human-Like Agents

Configure agents with names and contact information for tasks requiring personal interaction.

```python
product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    name="John Walk",
    contact="john@digitalfate.ai",
)
```

## Computer Use

Perform tasks that require human-like interactions, such as mouse movements and clicks.

```python
from digitalfate.client.tools import ComputerUse

tools = [ComputerUse]
```

## Reflection Mechanism

Ensure high-quality outputs by validating results and providing feedback for improvements.

```python
product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    reflection=True,
)
```

## Context Compression

Handle context overflow scenarios by compressing system messages and inputs automatically.

```python
product_manager_agent = AgentConfiguration(
    compress_context=True,
)
```

## Telemetry

Disable anonymous telemetry by setting an environment variable.

```python
import os
os.environ["digitalfate_TELEMETRY"] = "False"
```
